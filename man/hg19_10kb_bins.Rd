\title{10Kb bins from hg19 with GM12878 metadata annotation features}
\description{
10Kb bins were tiled across hg19 and annotated with CTCF and DNase
site features from GM12878. Feature annotations for each bin
include 1) the number of CTCF sites, 2) the CTCF signal strength
(from peak calls), 3) the number of DNase sites, 4) the DNase
signal strength (from signal tracks), and finally 5) the
presence/absence of a loop to any other bin. Function returns
a GRanges object with covariate metadata
