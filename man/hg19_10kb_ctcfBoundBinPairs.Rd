\title{CTCF-bound 10Kb paired genomic interactions}
\description{
10Kb bins were tiled across hg19 then subset by those which
contained CTCF sites. All pairs of CTCF-bound 10Kb bins were
generated and annotated with feature overlaps from GM12878. Feature
annotations include 1) presence/absence of a loop between
bin-pairs, 2) the total CTCF signal from both bin-pairs, 3) the
number of CTCF sites from both bin-pairs, 4) the distance between
bin-pairs, and finally 4) whether a convergent set of CTCF sites
exists between bin-pairs. Function returns
a GInteractions object with covariate metadata
